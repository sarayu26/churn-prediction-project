Phase 4: Power BI Dashboard Creation
Goal: Visualize insights and model predictions.

Import Data:

Open Power BI Desktop.
"Get data" -> "Text/CSV" and import your churn_predictions_for_dashboard.csv.
Data Transformation in Power Query (Optional, but good practice):

Even if cleaned in Python, Power Query can be used for final touches, renaming columns, changing data types, and setting up relationships if you have multiple tables.
DAX Measures:

Churn Rate: Churn Rate = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Table'), 'Table'[Churn] = "Yes"), COUNTROWS('Table')) (Adjust "Yes" based on your churn value).
High-Risk Customer Count: High-Risk Customers = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Table'), 'Table'[churn_probability] >= 0.7) (Adjust threshold based on your model's performance and business needs).
Average Churn Probability: Avg Churn Probability = AVERAGEX(ALL('Table'), 'Table'[churn_probability])
YoY/MoM Churn Change: If you have time series data.
Dashboard Design & Visualizations:

Overview Page:
KPI Cards: Total Customers, Churn Rate, High-Risk Customers.
Churn Rate Trend: Line chart over time (if time data available).
Churn Distribution by Key Drivers: Bar charts (e.g., Churn by Contract Type, Churn by Monthly Charges Segment, Churn by Internet Service). Use the insights from your EDA.
Customer Segmentation: Donut chart showing churn vs. non-churn.
"High-Risk Customers" Page (Drill-through or separate page):
Table Visual: List of high-risk customers with relevant details (e.g., Customer ID, Contract Type, Monthly Charges, Churn Probability).
Filters/Slicers: Department, Tenure, Service Type, Location.
Feature Importance Visual: Bar chart showing the most influential factors for churn (based on your model's feature importance).
"What-If" Analysis (Advanced/Optional): If you can integrate R/Python scripts directly into Power BI, you might create a "what-if" scenario for a new customer's churn probability.
Interactivity:

Use slicers for filtering by demographics, contract type, services, etc.
Implement drill-through actions to go from an aggregated view (e.g., a contract type) to a detailed list of customers within that type.
Add custom tooltips for more detail on hover.
Refine & Polish:

Consistent color scheme, clear titles, intuitive layout.
Ensure all visuals are linked and interact as expected.
Add text boxes explaining key findings and insights.
Phase 5: Documentation & Showcase
Goal: Present your project effectively.
